تفاصييل المشاريع : Project 1: Fatmote  - Food Discovery & Delivery App
Project Overview:
Fatmote  is a user-centric mobile application designed to streamline the process of discovering and ordering food. It focuses on personalizing the user experience from the moment they log in, offering tailored recommendations based on their preferences. The app aims to connect users with their favorite meals from a wide range of categories, making food ordering intuitive and efficient.

Key Features & Detailed Description:

Personalized Onboarding: The app features a dual entry point with "Log In" and "Sign Up" screens, ensuring a smooth start for both new and returning users. It includes standard security features like password recovery ("Forgot Password?").

User Authentication: Clean and simple login screens prompt users for their email or username and password. The sign-up process is streamlined for quick account creation.

Preference Selection: A core feature of Talmole is the "Choose the Food you love" screen. This onboarding step allows users to select their favorite food items, enabling the app to curate a highly personalized homepage and recommendation feed.

Categorized Content: Food options are organized into intuitive categories such as "Beginner" (potentially for simple dishes or new users), "Next" (perhaps for trending or next-level cuisine), and "Children" (family-friendly options). This structured categorization helps users navigate the vast menu options effortlessly.

System Integration (SYS 1-5): The project involved integrating with five distinct backend systems (SYS 1 through SYS 5). This likely handled core functionalities like user management (SYS 1), menu and restaurant data aggregation (SYS 2, SYS 3), order processing and payment gateway (SYS 4), and real-time delivery tracking (SYS 5).

User Flow:
The user is greeted by a welcome screen, proceeds to log in or create an account, and is then guided through a food preference selection process. Upon completion, they are presented with a main screen featuring restaurants and dishes aligned with their tastes, all powered by the integrated backend systems.

Design & UI:
The design prioritizes clarity and user action. It uses clear typography, prominent call-to-action buttons ("Log in," "Sign Up," "Next"), and a visually engaging interface for food selection, making the journey from landing to ordering seamless.

Project 2: Fitness & Nutrition Tracker App
Project Overview:
This is a comprehensive health and wellness application that combines workout guidance with detailed nutrition tracking. Its purpose is to provide users with a holistic tool to manage their fitness routines and dietary habits, all within a single, cohesive platform.

Key Features & Detailed Description:

Workout Library: The app features a dedicated "Workouts" section with a search function. It offers a variety of structured workout plans, including "Full Body Workout," "Upper Body Workout," "Lower Body Workout," and "Cardio Routine." Each workout is presented with a preview image (Prop31) and a unique identifier or hashtag (#Wlhafesr).

Nutrition Tracking Dashboard: A central "Nutrition" section provides a weekly overview (denoted by days S, M, T, W, T, F, S). This allows users to log and monitor their daily caloric intake.

Meal Logging: Users can track their meals by category: "Breakfast," "Lunch," and "Dinner." The placeholders (e.g., "3SD–33 – 4SP") suggest a detailed macronutrient and calorie breakdown for each meal item, indicating a sophisticated nutrition database.

Visual Data Representation: The interface uses a clean, card-based layout to display different workout plans and meal summaries, making it easy for users to digest information quickly and navigate between sections.

User Flow:
A user can start their day by reviewing their planned workout, then later log into the nutrition section to record their meals. The app serves as a daily companion for planning exercise and maintaining dietary goals.

Design & UI:
The design is functional and data-driven, utilizing bold headers to distinguish sections and a minimalist approach to present complex nutritional information clearly. The use of icons and abbreviated text ensures the interface remains uncluttered.

Project 3: Movie App (Cinematic Discovery Platform)
Project Overview:
This application is a feature-rich movie discovery and streaming platform designed for film enthusiasts. It provides detailed information about films, personalized recommendations, and a seamless way to continue watching content across devices.

Key Features & Detailed Description:

Detailed Movie Pages: Each film, like "Joker (2019)," has a dedicated screen showcasing its rating (★ 8.6/10), genres (Crime, Drama, Thriller), storyline synopsis, and cast information (e.g., Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck).

Content Discovery: A comprehensive "Category" section allows users to browse films by genre (Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Drama, Thriller, Horror, Crime) or view a "See All" list.

Continue Watching: This highly user-friendly feature remembers where a user left off in a movie (e.g., "Left at :56:40"), allowing them to resume playback instantly without searching for their spot.

Personalized Recommendations: The "Recommended For You" section is powered by an algorithm that suggests movies based on the user's viewing history and preferences, as seen with recommendations for "The Dark Knight," "Inception," and "Interstellar."

Rich Information: The app provides depth beyond just streaming, offering users context about the film through its storyline and cast details, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

User Flow:
A user can browse recommended movies on the home screen, explore by category, or pick up exactly where they left off in a film. Selecting a movie leads them to a detail page to learn more before watching.

Design & UI:
The design is immersive and visually focused, using movie posters and imagery prominently. Information is hierarchically organized, with ratings and genres immediately visible, followed by more detailed sections like Storyline and Cast. The dark theme is likely used to reduce eye strain and emulate a cinematic feel.

Project 4: Send Money App (FinTech Payment Solution)
Project Overview:
This is a modern, secure, and intuitive FinTech application designed for peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers and personal financial management. It simplifies sending and receiving money while providing users with clear insights into their transaction history and spending analytics.

Key Features & Detailed Description:

Dashboard & Balance Overview: The home screen greets the user by name ("Hi Octavian!") and displays the available balance prominently ($824.00), providing immediate financial clarity.

Quick Access Contacts: A "Favorites" section with user avatars (e.g., "Alexis," "Danielle") and a "+" button allows for adding frequent recipients, enabling rapid transactions.

Transaction History: A detailed "Recent Activity" log is organized chronologically ("Today," "August"), listing transactions (e.g., "Payment Received from Alexis Sanchez," "Send Money Success to Illiam Stephenson") with amounts and timestamps.

Money Transfer Process: The "Send Money" flow is secure and simple. It shows the available balance, allows selection from a list of recipients ("Send to Illiam Stephenson"), includes an option to "Add Notes" for context, and features a numeric keypad for entering the amount. The "Swipe to send money" action adds a layer of intentionality to prevent accidental transfers.

Financial Analytics: An "Analytics" section provides a high-level overview of the user's finances, breaking down "Income" ($721.00) and "Expenses" ($129.17) to aid in budgeting.

User Flow:
A user checks their balance on the dashboard, selects a favorite contact, enters an amount with an optional note, and swipes to confirm the transfer. They can later review the transaction in their activity feed or analyze their spending trends.

Design & UI:
The design emphasizes security, trust, and simplicity. It uses a clean layout with ample whitespace, clear transaction labels, and a structured information hierarchy. The "Swipe to send" mechanic is a modern and engaging interactive element.

Project 5: Travel App (Nature Exploration & Booking)
Project Overview:
This application inspires users to explore and book travel experiences focused on the natural world. It combines stunning visuals with essential trip information to help users discover beautiful destinations and plan their getaways.

Key Features & Detailed Description:

Destination: "Maldives."

Rating: "5.0" (out of 5), indicating a high-quality experience.

Modular Navigation: The notation "Sections 3" implies a bottom navigation bar or tabbed interface with three main sections (e.g., Explore, My Trips, Profile), allowing for easy exploration of other app features.

User Flow:
The user is inspired by the beautiful imagery and featured trip on the home screen. They can then explore other destinations through the navigation sections, ultimately proceeding to view details and book a trip.

Design & UI:
The design is highly visual and aspirational. It relies on breathtaking full-screen photography of destinations to create an emotional connection. Typography is bold and clear, overlayed on images to ensure readability. The information on the destination card is concise and strategically placed.

"Design a modern portfolio project modal window centered on the screen, with smooth rounded corners and soft shadows, matching the website’s color palette. The modal is divided into two main columns: on the left side, display a large rectangular PNG mockup inside an elegant frame with rounded edges, including a floating toolbar of interactive controls such as zoom in, zoom out, fit to screen, fullscreen view, rotate, and drag-to-pan functionality. On the right side, present clean and well-structured details: a bold project title at the top, a short descriptive paragraph below, a neat bulleted list of goals or features, a row of small tool icons or tags (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD), and two stylish call-to-action buttons at the bottom — one primary for ‘View Project’ and one secondary for ‘Download/External Link’. At the top-right corner, include a subtle close (X) button. Add smooth animations: fade and scale for opening/closing, hover zoom for the image, hover glow for buttons, and toolbar icons appearing elegantly when hovering over the image. The overall design should look clean, professional, and immersive, giving the impression of a high-end UI/UX case study presentation."
