نافذة.png : Design a sleek and modern presentation modal popup for a portfolio website that opens when a project card is clicked; the modal should be centered, full-screen with a semi-transparent background overlay that darkens the page, and the modal container should have soft rounded corners, subtle shadows, and padding consistent with the site’s style; on the left side, embed a presentation using an iframe (from Canva or similar), scaled responsively without showing external player controls, maintaining a clean look; above the iframe, add a project title in bold typography and below it a short description in smaller text for context; on the right side, create a vertical content section with (1) a project overview in clear readable text, (2) key highlights or features in bullet points with small modern icons, and (3) a single large, rounded primary button labeled “Download Presentation” aligned at the bottom for emphasis; ensure the design allows users to navigate or close the modal easily with a minimal X close button at the top-right; all colors, fonts, and accents should match the main website’s theme for visual consistency, and spacing should be balanced to avoid clutter while making the presentation itself the focal point.
